### Esquinzo vs Esquinzo (Jandía)
The database now has both:
- **Esquinzo (esquinzo):** 28.6348, -14.0267 (corrected)
- **Esquinzo (Jandía) (esquinzo-jandia):** 28.6348, -14.0267 (previously fixed)

These may be the same location or different spots with similar names. Further verification recommended.

9 spots still have no Google Maps representation:
- Acid Drop, El Pozo, Playa de la Turbia, Las Playas Muelle

- Major coordinate discrepancies remaining: 0
- Quality: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
