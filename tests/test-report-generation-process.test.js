// This process should be executed after all test suites have completed.

describe('SurfSpotPanel Test Report Generation Process', () => {

    test('1. Automated Test Results Aggregation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Collate results from all automated test suites into a single summary.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Run the full test suite using the test runner (e.g., `npm test` or a specific CI/CD pipeline command).
        // [ ] Ensure the test runner is configured to output results in a machine-readable format (e.g., JUnit XML for Playwright/Jest).
        // [ ] Collect the following report files from their respective output directories:
        //   - `results-browser-compatibility.xml`
        //   - `results-visual-regression.xml`
        //   - `results-performance.xml`
        //   - `results-accessibility.xml`
        //   - `results-e2e.xml`
        //   - `results-unit.xml`

        // **Output**: A set of XML/JSON files containing detailed results from each automated test category.
    });

    test('2. Cross-Browser Test Report Generation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Create a human-readable report detailing compatibility across different browsers and devices.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Parse the `results-browser-compatibility.xml` file.
        // [ ] Generate a markdown or HTML report with the following sections:
        //   - **Summary Table**: A matrix showing Pass/Fail status for each browser/device combination.
        //     | Browser        | Desktop Large | Desktop Medium | iPad (Portrait) | iPhone 12 | ... |
        //     |----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----|
        //     | Chromium       | Pass          | Pass           | Pass            | Pass      | ... |
        //     | Firefox        | Pass          | Fail           | Pass            | Pass      | ... |
        //     | WebKit (Safari)| Pass          | Pass           | Fail            | Pass      | ... |
        //   - **Failed Test Details**: List each failing test case with its corresponding browser/device, error message, and a link to the screenshot (if applicable).
        //   - **Known Issues**: A section for documenting any platform-specific limitations or bugs that are not immediately fixable.

        // **Output**: `cross-browser-test-report.md` or `cross-browser-test-report.html`
    });

    test('3. Visual Regression Test Report Generation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Compile a report of all visual comparison tests, highlighting any regressions.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Collect all generated screenshots from the visual regression tests.
        // [ ] The test runner (e.g., Playwright) should generate a default HTML report for visual diffs.
        // [ ] Enhance this report by adding:
        //   - A summary page with an overview of all comparison statuses (Passed/Failed/Unchanged).
        //   - Thumbnails of each screenshot, grouped by device and state.
        //   - For any failed comparisons, display the baseline, the actual, and a diff image side-by-side.
        //   - Filter options to view only failed tests or tests for a specific device.

        // **Output**: An HTML report, typically located in a `playwright-report` directory (e.g., `playwright-report/index.html`).
    });

    test('4. Performance Benchmark Report Generation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Create a report summarizing key performance metrics and benchmarks.

        // **Execution**:

        //     - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Average, Min, Max.
        //     - FID (First Input Delay): Average, Min, Max.
        //     - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Average, Min, Max.
        //     - TBT (Total Blocking Time): Average, Min, Max.
        //   - **Network Performance**:
        //     - Panel loading time on different network conditions (e.g., 3G, 4G).
        //     - Image lazy loading times.
        //   - **Interaction Performance**:
        //     - Tab switching and section toggle times.
        //   - **Memory Usage**:
        //     - Memory consumption during a series of interactions.
        //   - **Graphs and Charts**: Visualize the metrics over time or across different devices.

        // **Output**: `performance-benchmark-report.md` or `performance-benchmark-report.html`
    });

    test('5. Accessibility Test Report Generation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Document the results of automated accessibility checks and manual verification.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Parse the `results-accessibility.xml` file from axe-core or a similar tool.
        // [ ] Compile the manual testing checklist (`tests/manual-testing-checklist.test.js`) into a report format.
        // [ ] Generate a report with the following sections:
        //   - **Automated Checks Summary**:
        //     - Total number of violations, passes, and incomplete checks.
        //     - List of all violations with severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor) and affected elements.

        //     - A checklist-style table where testers can mark items as Pass/Fail/NA with notes.
        //     - Include sections for Keyboard Navigation, Screen Reader Testing, and Visual Accessibility.
        //   - **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for fixing identified issues.

        // **Output**: `accessibility-test-report.md` or `accessibility-test-report.html`
    });

    test('6. Manual Testing Report Consolidation', () => {
        // **Objective**: Formalize the findings from the manual testing session.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] The lead QA engineer should review the filled-out manual testing checklist.
        // [ ] Create a summary report that includes:
        //   - **Overall Usability Score**: A subjective score (e.g., 1-10) based on the tester's experience.

    });

    test('7. Final Cross-Platform Verification Report', () => {
        // **Objective**: Provide a final, high-level summary of the panel's consistency and user experience across all platforms.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Consolidate key findings from all other reports.
        // [ ] Write an executive summary that answers the following questions:
        //   - Is the panel functionally consistent across all supported browsers and devices?
        //   - Does the visual design render correctly everywhere?
        //   - Is the performance acceptable on both high-end and low-end devices/networks?
        //   - Is the panel accessible to users with disabilities?

    });

    test('8. Bug Tracking and Issue Integration', () => {
        // **Objective**: Ensure all identified issues are properly tracked.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] For every failed test case or manual testing finding, create an issue in the project's bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira).
        // [ ] The issue title should be descriptive and follow a consistent format (e.g., `[Bug] Component: Description of the issue`).
        // [ ] The issue body must include:

    });

    test('9. Report Distribution', () => {
        // **Objective**: Distribute the reports to all relevant stakeholders.

        // **Execution**:
        // [ ] Archive all generated reports (HTML, MD, XML) into a single zip file.
        // [ ] Name the archive with a version and date stamp (e.g., `surf-spot-panel-test-reports-v1.2.0-2023-10-27.zip`).
        // [ ] Upload the archive to a shared location (e.g., Google Drive, Confluence, or a dedicated reporting server).
        // [ ] Send an email notification to the project team with:
        //   - A link to the report archive.
            //   - A summary of the overall health of the panel.
