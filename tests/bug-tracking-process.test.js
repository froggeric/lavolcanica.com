describe('SurfSpotPanel Bug Tracking Process', () => {

    test('1. Issue Creation', () => {
        // **Objective**: To ensure every bug or unexpected behavior is logged with sufficient detail for reproduction.

        // **Tools**: GitHub Issues, Jira, or another designated project management tool.

        // **Procedure**:
        // [ ] When a bug is found (either from automated tests or manual testing), create a new issue immediately.
        // [ ] Use a clear and descriptive title that summarizes the problem.
        //   - **Format**: `[Type] Component: Brief Description`
        //   - **Example**: `[Bug] Panel: Close button does not work on mobile Safari`
        //   - **Example**: `[Accessibility] Waves Tab: Calendar grid is not announced by screen reader`
        //   - **Example**: `[Performance] Image Loading: Hero image takes >3s on 3G network`

        // **Mandatory Fields**:
        // [ ] **Description**: A detailed explanation of the issue.
        // [ ] **Environment**:
        //   - OS (e.g., iOS 16.1, Windows 11, macOS Ventura)
        //   - Browser (e.g., Chrome 118, Safari 16, Firefox 119)
        //   - Device (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23, Desktop)
        // [ ] **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered, step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow to see the bug.
        //   - 1. Navigate to...
        //   - 2. Click on...
        //   - 3. Observe that...
        // [ ] **Expected Behavior**: A clear statement of what should have happened.
        // [ ] **Actual Behavior**: A clear statement of what actually happened, including any error messages.
        // [ ] **Attachments**:
        //   - Screenshots or screen recordings for visual bugs.
        //   - Console logs for JavaScript errors.
        //   - Network logs (HAR file) if it's a performance or loading issue.
        // [ ] **Test Reference**: Link to the specific test case or checklist item that uncovered the issue.

        // **Output**: A well-documented issue in the tracking system.
    });

    test('2. Issue Labeling and Categorization', () => {
        // **Objective**: To make issues easy to filter, prioritize, and assign.

        // **Labels/Tags**:
        // [ ] **Type**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `documentation`
        // [ ] **Component**: `panel`, `tabs`, `calendar`, `images`, `accessibility`
        // [ ] **Priority**: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
        // [ ] **Source**: `automated-test`, `manual-testing`, `user-feedback`
        // [ ] **Browser/Device**: `chrome`, `firefox`, `safari`, `edge`, `ios`, `android`

        // **Procedure**:
        // [ ] The person creating the issue is responsible for applying the initial labels.
        // [ ] A lead engineer or QA lead will review and adjust labels and priority during triage.

        // **Output**: Issues are categorized for efficient workflow management.
    });

    test('3. Triage and Prioritization', () => {
        // **Objective**: To assess the impact of new bugs and decide on the order of resolution.

        // **Frequency**: Daily during the active testing phase.

        // **Participants**: QA Lead, Lead Frontend Engineer, Product Manager.

        // **Triage Meeting Agenda**:
        // [ ] Review all new, untriaged issues.
        // [ ] Assess impact based on:
        //   - **Severity**: How much does it break the user experience? (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor)
        //   - **Frequency**: How likely are users to encounter this bug?
        //   - **Scope**: Does it affect a core feature or an edge case?
        // [ ] Assign a priority level (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`).
        // [ ] Assign the issue to a developer or a team.
        // [ ] Estimate the effort required to fix (e.g., S, M, L story points).
        // [ ] Add the issue to the current sprint or backlog as appropriate.

        // **Output**: All new issues are triaged, prioritized, and assigned.
    });

    test('4. Bug Resolution Workflow', () => {
        // **Objective**: To define the lifecycle of a bug from creation to resolution.

        // **Workflow States**:
        // [ ] `Backlog` / `To Do`: Triage complete, ready to be picked up.
        // [ ] `In Progress`: A developer is actively working on the fix.
        // [ ] `In Review`: The fix is complete and ready for code review.
        // [ ] `Testing`: The fix is deployed to a staging environment for QA verification.
        // [ ] `Done` / `Closed`: The fix is verified, merged, and deployed.

        // **Procedure**:
        // [ ] **Developer**: Picks up an `In Progress` issue, creates a feature branch, and implements the fix.
        // [ ] **Developer**: Submits a pull request (PR) and moves the issue to `In Review`.
        // [ ] **Reviewer**: Reviews the code for correctness, performance, and adherence to standards.
        // [ ] **Reviewer**: Approves the PR and merges it into the main branch.
        // [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automatically deploys the change to a staging environment.
        // [ ] **QA Engineer**: Moves the issue to `Testing` and verifies the fix on the staging environment.
        //   - Must re-test the specific scenario.
        //   - Must perform a brief regression test of related functionality.
        // [ ] **QA Engineer**: If the fix is verified, moves the issue to `Done`. If not, reopens the issue with comments.
        // [ ] **Automation**: The issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged to the main branch.

        // **Output**: A transparent and traceable path from bug identification to resolution.
    });

    test('5. Regression Testing', () => {
        // **Objective**: To ensure that a fix for one bug does not introduce new ones.

        // **Procedure**:
        // [ ] For every `critical` or `high` priority bug fix, the full automated test suite must be run.
        // [ ] The QA engineer must perform targeted manual regression testing based on the area of the fix.
        //   - Example: If a tab navigation bug is fixed, test all tabs, expandable sections, and keyboard navigation.
        // [ ] If any new issues are found, they must be logged and linked back to the original issue.

        // **Output**: Confidence that the overall quality of the panel is maintained or improved with each fix.
    });

    test('6. Communication and Notifications', () => {
        // **Objective**: To keep all stakeholders informed about the status of bugs.

        // **Procedure**:
        // [ ] Configure the bug tracking tool to send notifications for key events:
        //   - New issue created.
        //   - Issue assigned.
        //   - PR submitted for review.
        //   - Issue moved to `Testing`.
        //   - Issue closed.
        // [ ] Use a dedicated Slack/Teams channel for real-time updates (e.g., `#qa-bug-tracker`).
        // [ ] The daily triage meeting summary should be posted in the channel.

        // **Output**: A transparent and collaborative environment.
    });

    test('7. Bug Metrics and Reporting', () => {
        // **Objective**: To analyze bug data to identify trends and improve the development process.

        // **Metrics to Track**:
        // [ ] **Bug Count**: Total number of open bugs, segmented by priority and component.
        // [ ] **Bug Age**: How long bugs remain open.
        // [ ] **Fix Rate**: Number of bugs resolved per week.
        // [ ] **Reopen Rate**: Percentage of bugs that had to be reopened after being marked `Done`.

        // **Reporting**:
        // [ ] The bug tracking tool's dashboard should be used to visualize these metrics.
        // [ ] A summary of key metrics should be included in the final test report.

        // **Output**: Data-driven insights to improve future development and testing cycles.
    });
