## Important Notes

These corrections address major coordinate discrepancies (>1km) that were identified during Google Maps integration but not automatically fixed due to conservative quality thresholds.

All coordinates have been validated to be within Fuerteventura's geographic bounds and are based on high-confidence Google Maps correlations.

## Remaining Work

Some spots still require manual verification:
- Spots with distances between 1-5km should be reviewed
- Low confidence correlations need local knowledge verification
- 9 existing spots without Google Maps matches should be documented
