TaskRef: "Version increment to 1.9.6"

Learnings:
- The `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` was empty, which required asking the user for the version increment type. This highlights the importance of developers keeping the changelog updated.
- The process for a simple patch increment is straightforward: update `data/config/app-config.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `README.md`.

Difficulties:
- None. The process was smooth.

Successes:
- Successfully followed the `Version increment.md` workflow to perform a patch release.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When `[Unreleased]` is empty, always ask the user for the increment type.
