# Fuerteventura Surf Spots Data Structure Documentation

This document describes the JSON data structure used to store information about surf spots in Fuerteventura. The data is located in the [`data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json`](data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json) file and serves as a comprehensive reference for anyone working with this data.

## 1. Overall Structure

The root of the JSON file is an object containing a single key, `spots`, which is an array of surf spot objects. Each object within this array represents a single surf spot and contains detailed information about it.

```json
{
  "spots": [
    {
      // Surf spot object 1
    },
    {
      // Surf spot object 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Surf Spot Object Fields

Each surf spot object has the following fields:

## 3. Data Rules and Conventions

*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   `id`: Kebab-case, derived from `primaryName`. Should be unique.
    *   `primaryName`: Title case for the main name.
*   **Enumerations (Allowed Values):**
    *   Many fields now use a controlled vocabulary (a set of allowed string values). These are highlighted in **bold** in the descriptions above. Adhering to this vocabulary is essential for data consistency.
*   **Missing Information:**
    *   For fields where information is not available or not applicable, use the JSON standard `null` value. This is programmatically clear and distinguishes from an empty string `""` or an empty array `[]`.
*   **Optional Fields:**
    *   Fields marked as `(optional)` can be omitted from the object entirely if no information is available. However, using `null` is preferred for consistency.

## 4. How to Add New Surf Spots

To add a new surf spot to the consolidated [`data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json`](data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json) file, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a unique `id`**: Generate a unique kebab-case identifier for the new spot based on its primary name.
2.  **Gather information**: Collect all relevant details, adhering to the standardized values for fields like `area`, `type`, `direction`, `bestTide`, `crowdFactor`, etc.
3.  **Populate the object**: Create a new JSON object for the surf spot. For any information that is genuinely unavailable, use the `null` value.
4.  **Maintain consistency**: Ensure that all standardized fields use only the allowed values listed in this documentation.
5.  **Insert into array**: Add the new surf spot object to the `spots` array in the [`data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json`](data/fuerteventura-surf-spots.json) file.
6.  **Validate JSON**: Before committing, ensure the JSON file remains valid.

## 5. Data Quality and Handling Missing Information

Maintaining high data quality is crucial for the utility of this dataset.

*   **Completeness**: Strive to fill in all fields. If information is truly unavailable after thorough research, use `null`.
*   **Accuracy**: Verify all factual information, especially coordinates, wave details, and hazards.
*   **Consistency**: Strictly use the predefined allowed values for standardized fields. This is the most important rule for maintaining a queryable database.
*   **Use of `null`**: The `null` value is the standard way to represent the absence of data. It is distinct from an empty array `[]` (which means "there are no items in this list") or an empty string `""` (which is a valid string of zero length). Using `null` correctly is key to programmatic handling of the data.

## 6. Guidelines for Maintaining the Data Structure

*   **Regular Review**: Periodically review existing entries for accuracy and completeness.
*   **Standardized Updates**: When updating information, ensure that changes adhere to the defined data structure and conventions.
*   **Documentation Updates**: If the data structure itself changes (e.g., new fields are added or existing ones are modified), this documentation (`surf-spots-data-structure.md`) must be updated accordingly.
*   **Version Control**: All changes to the JSON data and this documentation should be managed through version control (e.g., Git) to track history and facilitate collaboration.
