## Implementation Guide

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { SurfSpotPanel } from './scripts/surf-map/surf-spot-panel-optimized.js';

const panel = new SurfSpotPanel({
    container: document.getElementById('panel-container'),
    enableAnimations: true,
    enableTooltips: true,
    enableKeyboardNav: true,
    enablePerformanceOptimizations: true,
    onClose: () => {
        // Handle panel close
    }
});

// Generate content for a surf spot
const content = panel.generateContent(spotData);
panel.container.appendChild(content);
```

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Get performance metrics
const metrics = panel.getPerformanceMetrics();
console.log('Render time:', metrics.renderTime);
console.log('Image load time:', metrics.imageLoadTime);
console.log('Memory usage:', metrics.memoryUsage);

// Clear metrics
panel.clearPerformanceMetrics();
```

### Performance Mode Selection

```javascript
// Add performance mode class to body
document.body.classList.add('high-performance-mode');
document.body.classList.add('memory-optimized');
document.body.classList.add('network-slow');
document.body.classList.add('cpu-slow');
document.body.classList.add('battery-low');
```

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Test Page

Use the `test-surf-spot-panel-performance.html` file to test and validate the performance optimizations:

1. Open the test page in a browser
2. Use the performance controls to test different modes
3. Load different surf spots to measure performance
4. Run benchmarks to compare performance
5. Monitor live metrics for real-time performance data

### Benchmarking

Run the built-in benchmark to measure performance:

```javascript
// Run benchmark with 10 iterations
panel.runBenchmark(10);
```

### Memory Monitoring

Check memory usage:

```javascript
if (performance.memory) {
    const memoryInfo = {
        used: performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize,
        total: performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize,
        limit: performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit
    };
    
    console.log('Memory usage:', memoryInfo);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Performance Optimizations**: Always enable performance optimizations for production use.

2. **Use Appropriate Performance Modes**: Select the right performance mode based on device capabilities and network conditions.

3. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Regularly check performance metrics to identify optimization opportunities.

4. **Clean Up Resources**: Always call the `destroy()` method when removing the panel to prevent memory leaks.

5. **Test on Real Devices**: Test performance optimizations on a variety of real devices, especially low-powered mobile devices.
