# GPS Coordinate Research Sources Directory

## Multi-Language Search Strategy

### Search Languages
- **English (EN)**: Primary international surf terminology
- **Spanish (ES)**: Local Canary Islands context and official sources
- **German (DE)**: Large German surf tourism population in Fuerteventura
- **Italian (IT)**: Significant Italian surf community presence
- **French (FR)**: European surf market coverage

## Primary Source Categories

### Tier 1: Official Government/Maritime Data
**Priority:** Highest reliability
**Access Methods:**
- Government maritime charts (spanishhydrographic.org)
- Canary Islands official tourism portals (webfuerteventura.com)
- Municipal geographic information systems (GIS)
- Coastal management databases

### Tier 2: Professional Surf Platforms
**Priority:** High reliability with surf-specific context

**Surfline (surfline.com)**
- Search patterns: "Fuerteventura [spot name]", "Canary Islands [spot name]"

- MagicSeaweed forums
- SurferToday community boards
- Local Facebook surf groups (with verification)
- Reddit surf communities (r/surfing, r/fuerteventura)

## Geographic Reference Sources

### Map Validation Platforms
**Google Maps/Earth**
- Satellite imagery verification
- Street view coastal feature confirmation
- Coastal geography consistency checks

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)**
- Geographic data validation
- Coastal feature accuracy
- Trail and access point verification

### Maritime Charts
**Nautical Charts**
- Bathymetry data for reef breaks
- Coastal navigation markers
- Official maritime coordinates

## Multi-Language Search Patterns

### English Search Patterns
- "[spot name] Fuerteventura surf coordinates"
- "[spot name] surf GPS location Canary Islands"
- "[area] coast surf breaks near [nearest town]"
- "Fuerteventura surf spot [wave characteristic] location"

### Spanish Search Patterns
- "[spot name] surf coordenadas Fuerteventura"
- "[spot name] rompientes GPS Islas Canarias"
- "playas surf [area] cerca de [nearest town]"
- "Fuerteventura spots surf [wave characteristic] ubicación"

### German Search Patterns
- "[spot name] Fuerteventura Surf GPS Koordinaten"
- "[spot name] Wellenreiten Kanarische Inseln Position"
- "Surfspots [area] in der Nähe von [nearest town]"
- "Fuerteventura Surf [wave characteristic] Standort"

### Italian Search Patterns
- "[spot name] surf Fuerteventura coordinate GPS"

## Source-Specific Search Strategies

### Surfline Research Strategy
1. Use exact spot names first
2. Try area-based searches for lesser-known spots
3. Cross-reference with nearby major breaks
4. Verify coordinates with satellite imagery

### Google Maps Research Strategy
1. Search for spot name + "Fuerteventura"
2. Use alternative names and local variations
3. Cross-reference with nearby landmarks
4. Verify coastal feature consistency

### Local Sources Research Strategy
1. Search in local language first
2. Use geographical descriptors (near, west of, etc.)
3. Cross-reference with tourism information
4. Verify physical business location coordinates

## Quality Verification Protocols

### Cross-Reference Requirements
- Minimum 3 independent sources for VERIFIED status
- Map validation mandatory for all coordinate updates
- Source tier diversity (avoid reliance on single source type)
- Coordinate consistency within geographical logic

### Conflict Resolution
- Prioritize official sources over community sources
- Cross-reference with satellite imagery for final determination
- Document all conflicting sources and reasoning
- Flag unresolvable conflicts for manual review

## Source Attribution Standards

### Required Documentation
- Source name and URL
- Access date and time
- Search terms used
- Language of source
- Confidence assessment reasoning
- Any conflicts or discrepancies noted

### Source Reliability Tracking
- Tier level assignment justification
- Historical accuracy of source
- Cross-reference validation results
- Reusability assessment for future research
