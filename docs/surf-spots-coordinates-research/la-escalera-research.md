2. **Different "La Escalera" location** (possible multiple spots with same name)
3. **Data entry error** in current database

**Recommended Action:** Update coordinates to FreshSurf consensus: 28.6474736, -14.0217733

### Confidence Assessment

**Sources:** 3 independent sources found
- 1 with specific coordinates (Mondo.surf)
- 2 with descriptive location data
- 1 tourism review source

**Map Validation:**
- Coordinates 28.649128, -14.021887 appear to place location further south than expected
- Current coordinates 28.687, -13.83 may be more accurate for El Cotillo area
- Need satellite imagery validation

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM
- Single coordinate source with conflicting data
- Good descriptive sources but need coordinate verification
- Significant coordinate variation (>1km) requires manual review

### Recommendations

1. **FLAG FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION** - Coordinate conflict too significant
2. Cross-reference with satellite imagery
3. Verify with local surf schools or government coastal data
4. Current coordinates may be more accurate than found source
