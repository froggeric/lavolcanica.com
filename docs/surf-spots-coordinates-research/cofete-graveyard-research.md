- West coast faces full Atlantic exposure
- Remote area accessible only through mountains
- Characterized by dramatic cliffs and wild coastline

### Regional West Coast Pattern
From Fuerteventura west coast characteristics:
- **West Coast Orientation:** Faces due west for maximum Atlantic exposure
- **Wave Power:** Consistently more powerful than east coast
- **Remoteness:** Limited access, undeveloped coastline
- **Geographic Formation:** Mountain backdrop, cliff formations

## Coordinate Analysis

### Current Coordinates Evaluation
**Coordinates:** 28.7415° N, -13.9353° W

**Geographic Plausibility Check:**
- **Latitude:** 28.7415° N - Places in central-west Fuerteventura
- **Longitude:** -13.9353° W - Positions on western side of island
- **Coastal Proximity:** Coordinates suggest coastal positioning
- **West Coast Logic:** Longitude places correctly on west-facing coast

### Comparative West Coast Analysis
**Regional Coordinate Patterns:**
- **Southern Tip Area:** ~28.05° N, -14.3° to -14.5° W
- **Central West Coast:** ~28.6° to 28.8° N, -13.9° to -14.0° W
- **Northern West Coast:** ~28.7° to 28.8° N, -13.8° to -13.9° W
- **Cofete Area:** Should be in central-south west region

**Cofete Coordinates Consistency:**
- **Latitude:** 28.7415° N places correctly in central west
- **Longitude:** -13.9353° W places on western coastline
- **West Coast Positioning:** Consistent with west-facing exposure
