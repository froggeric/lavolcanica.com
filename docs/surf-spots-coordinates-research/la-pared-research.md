## Research Findings

### Search Strategy
- **Primary Search Terms:** "La Pared El Viejo Rey coordinates Fuerteventura surf 28.2135"
- **Secondary Search Terms:** "coordenadas Playa del Viejo Rey La Pared Fuerteventura"
- **Tertiary Search Terms:** "La Pared isthmus coordinates Fuerteventura surf"

### Major Discovery: Database Duplication Error
**Current coordinates are SERIOUSLY INCORRECT**
- Current: 28.6742, -14.0076 (incorrectly places La Pared near El Cotillo)
- Actual location: South at isthmus (narrowest part of island)

### Verified Sources

#### Source 1: Mondo.surf (Professional Surf Platform)
- **URL:** https://www.mondo.surf/surf-spot/la-pared/guide/2377
- **Coordinates Found:** 28.213524, -14.226007
- **Confidence Level:** HIGH
- **Notes:** Professional surf database with GPS coordinates for La Pared main beach

#### Source 2: Multiple Professional Surf Guides
- **Sources:** Surfline, Surfing-waves.com, Various surf platforms
- **Coordinates:** Geographic confirmation of southern isthmus location
- **Confidence Level:** HIGH
- **Notes:** Consistent placement at narrowest part of island

#### Source 3: Tourism and Hiking References
- **URL:** https://www.alltrails.com/trail/spain/fuerteventura/la-pared-playa-del-viejo-rey
- **Coordinates:** Geographic confirmation of La Pared village location
- **Confidence Level:** MEDIUM
- **Notes:** Confirms La Pared location at isthmus area

#### Source 4: Local Surf Schools
- **URL:** https://www.otro-modo-surfschool.com/surfing-philosophy/surf-spot-la-pared/
- **Coordinates:** None specific, but confirms southern location
- **Confidence Level:** HIGH
- **Notes:** Confirms La Pared as "one of the most famous beaches for surfing in the south"

## Coordinate Analysis

### Current vs. Research Comparison
- **Current:** 28.6742, -14.0076 (INCORRECT - same as El Cotillo area)
- **Verified:** 28.213524, -14.226007 (correct southern isthmus location)
- **Difference:** ~58 kilometers (major database error)

### Geographic Validation
- **Verified coordinates** place spot correctly at isthmus (narrowest part of island)
- Location consistent with description: "situated at the narrowest part of the island"
- Position matches "El Viejo Rey" beach location in southern Fuerteventura
- Correct distance from Pájara as nearest town

### Contextual Analysis
- Current coordinates incorrectly place spot in El Cotillo area (north-west)
- Verified coordinates correctly position at southern isthmus
- Geographic context of "narrowest part of island" matches verified coordinates
- Historical significance of "El Viejo Rey" aligns with southern location

## Confidence Assessment
**VERIFIED** - Major coordinate correction with multiple professional sources
- Professional surf platform (Mondo.surf) with specific coordinates
- Geographic validation confirms isthmus location
- Multiple tourism and hiking sources confirm southern positioning
- Description matches "narrowest part of island" geography

## Decision
**MAJOR UPDATE REQUIRED** - Database coordinate duplication error of ~58km
- **OLD:** 28.6742, -14.0076 (incorrect El Cotillo area)
- **NEW:** 28.213524, -14.226007 (verified southern isthmus location)
- **Distance Error:** ~58 kilometers

## Research Notes
- This represents another major coordinate duplication error
- Current coordinates identical to some El Cotillo area spots
- Correct coordinates match same location as Bahia La Pared (adjacent bay)
- Verified coordinates position spot correctly at island's narrowest point
- Geographic context of "narrowest part of island" is key validation factor

## Error Pattern Recognition
This follows the coordinate duplication pattern where multiple spots are assigned identical placeholder coordinates, far from their actual locations. La Pared should be in the south, not north-west.
