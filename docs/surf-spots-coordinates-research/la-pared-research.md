## Coordinate Analysis

### Current vs. Research Comparison
- **Current:** 28.6742, -14.0076 (INCORRECT - same as El Cotillo area)
- **Verified:** 28.213524, -14.226007 (correct southern isthmus location)
- **Difference:** ~58 kilometers (major database error)

### Geographic Validation
- **Verified coordinates** place spot correctly at isthmus (narrowest part of island)
- Location consistent with description: "situated at the narrowest part of the island"
- Position matches "El Viejo Rey" beach location in southern Fuerteventura
- Correct distance from Pájara as nearest town

### Contextual Analysis
- Current coordinates incorrectly place spot in El Cotillo area (north-west)
- Verified coordinates correctly position at southern isthmus
- Geographic context of "narrowest part of island" matches verified coordinates
- Historical significance of "El Viejo Rey" aligns with southern location

## Confidence Assessment
**VERIFIED** - Major coordinate correction with multiple professional sources
- Professional surf platform (Mondo.surf) with specific coordinates
- Geographic validation confirms isthmus location
- Multiple tourism and hiking sources confirm southern positioning
- Description matches "narrowest part of island" geography

## Decision
**MAJOR UPDATE REQUIRED** - Database coordinate duplication error of ~58km
- **OLD:** 28.6742, -14.0076 (incorrect El Cotillo area)
- **NEW:** 28.213524, -14.226007 (verified southern isthmus location)
- **Distance Error:** ~58 kilometers

## Research Notes
- This represents another major coordinate duplication error
- Current coordinates identical to some El Cotillo area spots
- Correct coordinates match same location as Bahia La Pared (adjacent bay)
- Verified coordinates position spot correctly at island's narrowest point
- Geographic context of "narrowest part of island" is key validation factor

## Error Pattern Recognition
This follows the coordinate duplication pattern where multiple spots are assigned identical placeholder coordinates, far from their actual locations. La Pared should be in the south, not north-west.
