6. punta-elena (North East - named point)
7. waikiki-beach (North East - English reference)

**Estimated Research Time:** 35-50 minutes
**Special Considerations:** High tourist documentation, English/Spanish sources

---

## Batch 4: South Coast (Mixed Languages)
**Agent:** GPS Research Batch Agent 4
**Research Complexity:** Medium-High (multilingual tourist areas)
**Spots:**
1. cruz-roja (South - Spanish, "Red Cross")

**Estimated Research Time:** 40-55 minutes
**Special Considerations:** Strong German tourist presence, local place names

---

## Batch 5: West Coast (Advanced Coastal Research)
**Agent:** GPS Research Batch Agent 5
**Research Complexity:** High (exposed coastline, varied break types)
**Spots:**
1. bahia-la-pared (West - compound Spanish name)
2. campo-de-futbol (West - Spanish, "soccer field")
3. el-cotillo-piedra-playa (West - compound location reference)
4. spew-pits (West - English descriptive)
5. la-pared (West - Spanish, "the wall")
6. playa-de-las-mujeres-jarugo (West - compound Spanish)
7. playade-garcey-racetracks (West - descriptive reference)

**Estimated Research Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Special Considerations:** Exposed coastline, multiple break types, fishing port references

---

## Batch 6: Offshore and East Coast (Special Cases)
**Agent:** GPS Research Batch Agent 6
**Research Complexity:** Mixed (offshore island, less-documented areas)
**Spots:**
1. isla-de-lobos (Offshore - famous small island)
2. pico-de-las-motos (East - Spanish descriptive)
3. playa-blanca (East - Spanish geographic)
4. puerto-lajas (East - port reference)
5. punta-gorda (North - geographic point)
6. suicidios (North - dramatic name)
7. punta-del-tigre (South - geographic reference)

**Estimated Research Time:** 40-55 minutes
**Special Considerations:** Island research requires maritime charts, port locations for verification

## Batch Processing Protocol

### Agent Instructions (Standard for All Batches)

**Core Research Methodology:**
1. **Multi-Language Search**: Execute searches in EN, ES, DE, IT, FR using all name variations
2. **Source Verification**: Minimum 3 independent sources for VERIFIED status
3. **Map Validation**: Cross-reference with Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and maritime charts
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Apply established confidence level criteria
5. **Immediate Updates**: Update coordinates for VERIFIED/HIGH confidence findings

**Language Priority by Batch:**
- Batches 1, 2, 6: ES → EN → DE → IT → FR (Spanish priority)
- Batches 3, 4: DE → ES → EN → IT → FR (German tourism priority)
- Batch 5: ES → EN → DE → IT → FR (Local Spanish priority)

**Error Recovery Protocol:**
- Progressive search complexity escalation
- Alternative naming convention exploration
- Geographical descriptor cross-referencing
- Nearby landmark coordinate triangulation

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

**After Each Batch:**
1. Cross-batch coordinate consistency validation
2. Source quality audit
3. Documentation completeness review
4. Progress metrics update
5. Next batch preparation

**Final Consolidation:**
1. Geographic consistency across all 42 spots
2. Statistical distribution analysis
3. Source directory updates
4. Comprehensive final report generation

## Timeline Estimation

**Estimated Total Research Time:** 4.5-6 hours
**Batch Processing Time:** 35-60 minutes per batch
**Quality Assurance Time:** 30-45 minutes total
**Documentation and Reporting:** 30-45 minutes

**Start Time:** TBD (upon supervisor approval)
**Estimated Completion:** TBD (4.5-6 hours after start)
