- Access via North Track road

## Confidence Assessment

### Coordinate Analysis
- **Found Coordinates:** 28.74213172, -13.95148873 (from Surfsphere)
- **Current Coordinates:** 28.7415, -13.9353
- **Coordinate Distance:** ~1.6km difference
- **Quality:** Only 1 direct coordinate source found

### Source Reliability Score
- **Tier 2 Sources:** 2 (Surfsphere with coordinates, Mondo.surf mentioned)
- **Tier 3 Sources:** 2 (Local surf camps with geographic descriptions)
- **Geographic Validation:** Partial - descriptions align with North Shore location

### Verification Status
**CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM**
- Rationale: Single reliable coordinate source with good geographic validation
- Coordinate variation is significant but understandable given location complexity
- Multiple sources confirm geographic context but only one provides exact coordinates

## Recommendation

**FLAG FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION**

### Issues to Address:
1. **Coordinate Distance:** 1.6km variation needs verification with additional sources
2. **Limited Direct GPS Data:** Only one source provides exact coordinates
3. **Geographic Complexity:** Multiple "Hierro" spots in close proximity require precise identification

### Suggested Verification Methods:
1. Cross-reference with additional surf platforms
2. Satellite imagery analysis of reef formations
3. Local surf school knowledge for precise spot identification
4. Check against official Spanish coastal mapping data

## Research Notes

- The Bubble is part of the famous "El Hierro" section with multiple breaks
- Alternative names (Hierro Right, El Hierro) suggest connection to broader spot complex
- Geographic descriptions consistently place it near Majanicho on North Shore
- Professional surf platforms recognize it as a significant spot
- Current coordinates may represent general area rather than precise break location
