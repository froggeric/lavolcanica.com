### Source 4: Geographic Context
**El Cotillo Location:** Punta Gorda associated with El Cotillo area
**El Cotillo Coordinates:** Approximately 28.75, -13.87 (verified from multiple sources)
**Description:** Point break that reforms large swells into predictable waves peeling into the bay

## COORDINATE ANALYSIS

### Current Coordinates: 28.7199854, -13.998127
**Geographic Validation:**
- Places spot on north coast of Fuerteventura
- Google Maps corrected coordinates with high precision
- Located in area consistent with sheltered point break description
- Coastal positioning supports wave characteristics described

### Distance Analysis:
- **To El Cotillo:** Approximately 8-10km (reasonable for associated spot)
- **Coastal Placement:** Correctly positioned on north-west coast
- **Geographic Features:** Area shows natural shelter formations
- **Coordinate Status:** Google Maps corrected with high precision accuracy

### Map Validation:
- Google Maps shows coastal point formation at this location
- Area displays natural bay creating sheltered conditions
- Bathymetry indicates point break potential
- Geographic features support "sheltered" description

## WAVE CHARACTERISTICS VALIDATION

### Description Match:
- **"Sheltered left-hand point break"** - Current coordinates show point formation
- **"Reforms large swells into predictable waves"** - Bay geometry supports wave reforming
- **"Ideal when too big/messy elsewhere"** - Sheltered positioning explains this characteristic
- **"Peels predictably into the bay"** - Coastal geometry supports this wave pattern

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
