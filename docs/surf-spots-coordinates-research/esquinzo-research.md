# Esquinzo GPS Coordinates Research

**Research Date:** 2025-11-14
**Spot ID:** esquinzo
**Primary Name:** Esquinzo
**Alternative Names**: ["Playa de Esquinzo"]

## Current Coordinates in Database
- Latitude: 28.6742
- Longitude: -14.0076
- Accuracy: unverified

## Research Context
**Geographic Description Analysis:**
- Beautiful beach break below tourist settlement
- Known for gentle, long-running left-hand waves
- Reminiscent of classic surf films
- Reliable spot powered by wind swells
- Favorite for beginners and longboarders

**Key Geographic Indicators:**
- Below tourist settlement (geographic anchor)
- Similar characteristics to Esquinzo (Jandía)
- Costa Calma, Butihondo, Morro Jable as nearest towns

## MAJOR COORDINATE ERROR IDENTIFIED

### Geographic Plausibility Analysis
**Current Coordinates:** 28.6742° N, -14.0076° W

**Critical Geographic Problems:**
1. **Latitude:** 28.6742° N places location in NORTH Fuerteventura
2. **Longitude:** -14.0076° W places location far inland/away from coast
3. **Distance Error:** Approximately 70km north of expected southern location
4. **Area Conflict:** Described as "South" area but coordinates place in North

### Comparative Analysis with Esquinzo (Jandía)
**Geographic Relationship:**
- **Esquinzo (Jandía):** 28.0721° N, -14.3044° W (southern tip)
- **Esquinzo:** 28.6742° N, -14.0076° W (northern inland)
- **Latitude Difference:** 0.6021° = ~66km northward error
- **Longitude Difference:** 0.2968° = significant positioning error

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Same base name suggests related/identical location
- Descriptions nearly identical between both spots
- Both described as below tourist settlements
- Similar wave characteristics and user types

## Systematic Coordinate Error Pattern

### Previous Batch Error Discovery
**Las Playas Muelle Precedent:**
- Previous batch discovered 54km geographic error
- North classification instead of Southeast actual location
- Systematic placeholder coordinate usage identified
- Major corrections successfully implemented

**Current Error Characteristics:**
- Similar magnitude of geographic error (~70km)
- North placement for clearly southern location
- Coordinates inconsistent with description
- Pattern matches systematic placeholder issues

## Geographic Logic Analysis

### Expected Location Characteristics
**Based on Description:**
- Should be in southern Fuerteventura
- Should be coastal (beach break)
- Should be near Costa Calma/Butihondo area
- Should be accessible from Morro Jable
- Should have tourist settlement nearby

### Correct Location Logic
**Relationship to Esquinzo (Jandía):**
- Likely identical or very nearby location
- Both reference same beach area
- Both describe same wave characteristics
- Both reference same nearest towns
- Alternative name "Playa de Esquinzo" matches

### Regional Geographic Context
**Southern Jandía Pattern:**
- **Expected Latitude:** 28.0° to 28.2° N range
- **Expected Longitude:** -14.2° to -14.4° W range
- **Coastal Positioning:** Must be on coastline
- **Settlement Access:** Near tourist developments

## Coordinate Error Impact Analysis

### Navigation Consequences
**Current Error Effects:**
- Users directed to northern inland location
- 70km distance from actual surf spot
- Inaccessible from referenced towns
- Complete geographic misdirection

### Database Integrity Issues
**Systematic Problems:**
- Multiple spots with major coordinate errors
- Placeholder coordinate usage patterns
- Area classification conflicts
- Geographic relationship breakdowns

## Correction Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required
**Coordinate Correction:**
- Current coordinates: 28.6742, -14.0076 (ERROR)
- Should match Esquinzo (Jandía): 28.0721, -14.3044
- Alternatively, nearby coordinates in southern Jandía area

### Geographic Validation
**Correct Location Characteristics:**
- **Latitude:** ~28.07° N (southern Jandía)
- **Longitude:** ~-14.30° W (east coast)
- **Coastal Position:** On east coast of Jandía peninsula
- **Settlement Proximity:** Near Butihondo/Costa Calma

## Source Credibility Assessment
**Error Pattern Strength:**
- Clear geographic impossibility with current coordinates
- Strong similarity to Esquinzo (Jandía) description
- Consistent with systematic placeholder error patterns
- Matches previous batch error discoveries

**Correction Confidence:**
- HIGH confidence that current coordinates are incorrect
- HIGH confidence that correct location is in southern Jandía
- MEDIUM confidence on exact coordinates (needs external verification)

## Confidence Assessment
**LOW** - Current coordinates have major geographic errors requiring correction

**Critical Issues:**
1. **70km geographic error** (north instead of south)
2. **Inland positioning** for coastal beach break
3. **Area classification conflict** (South area, North coordinates)
4. **Town relationship impossibility** (cannot access from referenced towns)

## Recommended Actions
**IMMEDIATE COORDINATE CORRECTION REQUIRED**
- Update coordinates to match southern Jandía location
- Cross-reference with Esquinzo (Jandía) coordinates
- Verify with external sources when available
- Update accuracy status after correction

## Suggested Correction
**Proposed New Coordinates:** 28.0721, -14.3044
- **Rationale:** Matches Esquinzo (Jandía) with identical description
- **Alternative:** Nearby coordinates in 28.07° N, -14.30° W range
- **Status:** Requires verification but clearly more accurate than current

## Geographic Error Alert
**MAJOR ERROR DISCOVERED:** 70km coordinate error placing spot in wrong region entirely. Similar to Las Playas Muelle error discovered in previous batch.
