## Geographical Context
- **Area:** North East Fuerteventura
- **Nearest Town:** Corralejo
- **Location:** Between Corralejo and Isla de Lobos
- **Landmarks:** Opposite Lobos Island, at southern end of Corralejo
- **Beach Access:** Near Avenida Grandes Playas 83
- **Distance:** 15-20 minute walk from main Corralejo strip

## Map Validation Analysis

### Geographic Positioning Logic:
1. **Lobos Island:** 28.7500, -13.8167 (northeast of Fuerteventura)
2. **Corralejo Center:** Approximately 28.7, -13.9
3. **Punta Elena:** Positioned between these two points
4. **Current DB Coordinates:** 28.73, -13.94

### Coordinate Analysis
The current coordinates (28.73, -13.94) place the spot:
- **North of Corralejo town center:** Correct for position between town and Lobos
- **West of Lobos Island:** Potentially too far west
- **Coastal positioning:** Plausible for reef break location

### Area Classification Concern
**MAJOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** Current coordinates 28.73, -13.94 place the spot significantly inland (~2-3km from coast). This appears to be a major geographic error similar to previous batches.

## Source Credibility Assessment
- **Source 1 (Lobos Coordinates):** High - Verified geographic data
- **Source 2 (Address References):** High - Multiple booking platforms
- **Source 3 (Tourism Descriptions):** High - Consistent across platforms
- **Source 4 (Surf Knowledge):** Medium - Database description
- **Source 5 (German Platform):** High - Local surf school knowledge

## Confidence Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Strong geographical context and landmark references, but no precise GPS coordinates found for the surf spot itself. Current database coordinates appear to be significantly incorrect (inland positioning).

## Recommended Coordinates
**28.735, -13.875** (Estimated based on geographic logic: between Corralejo and Lobos, on coastline)

## Update Decision
**MEDIUM - Flag for manual review**
- No direct GPS sources for surf spot found
- Strong geographic context suggests current coordinates are incorrect
- Requires manual verification with detailed mapping
- Cannot update with high confidence from available sources

## Additional Notes
- **Alternative Names:** Well-documented as "Bajo del Medio" and "Rocky Point"
- **Surf Characteristics:** Prominent reef break, right-hand wave, works when North Shore is large
- **Tourist Infrastructure:** "Punta Elena Beach" apartment complex at Avenida Grandes Playas 83
- **Accessibility:** 15-20 minute walk from main Corralejo strip
- **Geographic Relation:** Clearly positioned between Corralejo and Lobos Island

## Major Issue Identified
**Potential Geographic Error:** Current coordinates appear to place the spot inland rather than on the coast. This requires manual verification similar to the Las Playas Muelle error discovered in Batch 2.
