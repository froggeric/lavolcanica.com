# El Pozo GPS Coordinates Research

**Research Date:** 2025-11-14
**Spot ID:** el-pozo
**Primary Name:** El Pozo
**Alternative Names:** []

## Current Coordinates in Database
- Latitude: 28.05
- Longitude: -14.3
- Accuracy: unverified

## Research Context
**Geographic Description Analysis:**
- Located directly in front of iconic Jandía lighthouse
- Southernmost surf spot on Fuerteventura
- Clean, wind-swell-generated left-hand waves
- Consistent offshore winds make it summer favorite
- Versatile wave: hollow steep section near lighthouse, longer walls further down beach

**Key Geographic Indicators:**
- Direct relationship to Jandía lighthouse (critical anchor point)
- Southernmost location status
- Beach break with point-like characteristics near lighthouse
- Left-hand wave orientation suggests specific coastal geometry

## Geographic Analysis Based on Context

### Jandía Lighthouse Reference Point
**Critical Geographic Anchor:**
- Jandía lighthouse is major landmark at southern tip
- El Pozo "directly in front" indicates immediate proximity
- Lighthouse coordinates serve as reliable reference

### Southern Tip Pattern Analysis
From previous research of southern spots:
- Cruz Roja (also southern tip): 28.05, -14.3
- Esquinzo areas: various coordinates around 28.07° to 28.67° N
- Cofete (west coast): 28.74°, -13.93°
- Southern tip latitude range: 28.04° to 28.06° N

## Coordinate Duplication Issue Identified

### Database Pattern Analysis
**Major Concern:** El Pozo has identical coordinates to Cruz Roja (28.05, -14.3)

**Pattern Recognition from Previous Batches:**
- Multiple spots with identical coordinates indicate placeholder data
- Previous batches discovered similar duplication issues
- Las Playas Muelle had 54km coordinate error due to placeholder usage
- Systematic coordinate duplication is a known database issue

### Geographic Logic Analysis
**El Pozo vs Cruz Roja Differentiation:**
- **El Pozo:** Beach break in front of Jandía lighthouse
- **Cruz Roja:** Point break named after Red Cross house
- Both described as southernmost but with different characteristics
- Should have distinct but nearby locations

## Lighthouse-Based Geographic Analysis

### Jandía Lighthouse Location Logic
**Known Geographic Reference:**
- Major lighthouse at Punta de Jandía (southern tip)
- Typically located on prominent headland/cap
- Beach breaks form in front of such landmarks
- Lighthouse coordinates should be verifiable

### Wave Orientation Analysis
**Left-Hand Wave Requirements:**
- Requires specific coastal orientation
- Beach configuration must support left-breaking waves
- "Hollow and steep section right in front of lighthouse" indicates immediate proximity
- Suggests lighthouse is on headland with beach extending from it

## Comparative Geographic Analysis

### Southern Spots Coordinate Pattern
From current database research:
- **El Pozo:** 28.05, -14.3 (identical to Cruz Roja)
- **Cruz Roja:** 28.05, -14.3 (identical to El Pozo)
- **Esquinzo-Jandia:** 28.0721, -14.3044 (verified, nearby but distinct)
- **Esquinzo:** 28.6742, -14.0076 (appears to have major error)

### Geographic Relationship Logic
- El Pozo should be very close to Jandía lighthouse
- Cruz Roja should be near but distinct from El Pozo
- Esquinzo-Jandia coordinates (28.0721, -14.3044) suggest southern tip area
- Identical coordinates indicate placeholder data issue

## Source Credibility Assessment
**Limitations:**
- Unable to verify Jandía lighthouse exact coordinates
- No access to maritime charts or surf platform data
- Limited to geographic pattern analysis

**Available Analysis Strengths:**
- Clear coordinate duplication identified
- Strong geographic logic from descriptions
- Pattern recognition from previous batch research
- Understanding of placeholder coordinate issues

## Confidence Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Strong evidence of coordinate duplication issue requiring resolution, but need external sources to verify exact lighthouse location.

**Key Findings:**
- Identical coordinates to Cruz Roja indicate placeholder usage
- Lighthouse reference provides excellent verification opportunity
- Geographic logic suggests proximity but distinct location
- Pattern matches previous batch coordinate duplication discoveries

## Recommended Actions
**MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED**
- Verify exact Jandía lighthouse coordinates
- Resolve coordinate duplication with Cruz Roja
- Confirm beach break location relative to lighthouse
- Cross-reference with maritime charts or local guides

## Geographic Recommendation (Preliminary)
Based on available analysis:
- **Latitude:** Should be very close to 28.05° N (southern tip confirmed)
- **Longitude:** Should be distinct from Cruz Roja, likely within 28.0-28.1° N, -14.3 to -14.4° W range
- **Distinct Position:** Must differentiate from Cruz Roja while maintaining southern tip proximity

## Coordinate Duplication Pattern Alert
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** This spot exhibits the same coordinate duplication pattern found in previous batches, indicating systematic placeholder data usage in the database.
