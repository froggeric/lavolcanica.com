## Map Validation Analysis

### Geographic Positioning:
1. **Current Coordinates:** 28.73, -13.94
2. **Location Description:** "Heart of Corralejo"
3. **Context:** Sheltered bay in Corralejo
4. **Infrastructure:** Multiple hotels and beach clubs in area

### Coordinate Analysis
The current coordinates (28.73, -13.94) present the same geographic issue as Punta Elena:
- **Position:** Significantly inland (~2-3km from coast)
- **Expected Location:** Should be on coast in sheltered Corralejo bay
- **Area:** Should be near town center, not inland

### Correlation with Other Spots
- **Proximity to Punta Elena:** Both share similar incorrect coordinates
- **Expected Relationship:** Both should be in Corralejo area, but on coast
- **Tourism Infrastructure:** High density of hotels and businesses confirms prime location

## Source Credibility Assessment
- **Source 1 (Hotel Address):** High - Specific street address in Waikiki area
- **Source 2 (Tourism Platforms):** High - Multiple independent booking platforms
- **Source 3 (AllTrails):** High - Geographic context with nearby landmarks
- **Source 4 (Beach Club):** High - Commercial establishment on the beach

## Confidence Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Strong contextual evidence for location within Corralejo bay, but current database coordinates appear to be significantly incorrect (inland positioning). Multiple tourism sources confirm beachfront location in town.

## Recommended Coordinates
**28.718, -13.867** (Estimated based on logic: center of Corralejo bay, near town, on coast)

## Update Decision
**MEDIUM - Flag for manual review**
- No precise GPS coordinates found for surf spot itself
- Strong evidence current coordinates are geographically incorrect
- Multiple tourism sources confirm beachfront location in town
- Requires manual verification with detailed mapping
- Cannot update with high confidence from available sources

## Additional Notes
- **Primary Function:** Sheltered bay, primary hub for wing foiling and windsurfing
- **Surf Characteristics:** Gentle, accessible wave in middle of bay on smaller days
- **Beginner Friendly:** Popular for beginner surfers due to easy access
- **Protection:** Sheltered from strong wind and currents
- **Alternative Names:** Well-documented as "Playa Waikiki" and "Galera Beach"
- **Tourism Significance:** High density of tourism infrastructure in immediate area

## Major Issue Identified
**Potential Geographic Error:** Current coordinates appear to place the spot inland rather than in the sheltered Corralejo bay. This requires manual verification, similar to the Punta Elena issue identified earlier.

## 🎯 FINAL COORDINATE STATUS (November 2025)

**Current Database Coordinates:**
- **Latitude:** 28.7345635
- **Longitude:** -13.8669294
- **Accuracy:** google_maps_corrected
- **Verification Date:** November 15, 2025

**Status Summary:** ✅ GPS coordinates corrected and verified
- Major geographic error resolved through Google Maps integration
- Inland positioning corrected to proper sheltered bay location
- Production-ready with google_maps_corrected accuracy status

**Coordinate Accuracy:** Major correction successfully implemented. Initial research identified significant geographic error with coordinates placing spot inland rather than in sheltered Corralejo bay. Google Maps integration corrected coordinates (28.7345635, -13.8669294) to properly position Waikiki Beach in sheltered Corralejo bay near town center with beachfront access. Multiple tourism sources confirmed location through hotel addresses, beach club references, and proximity to Corralejo Dunes.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Initial coordinates had major geographic positioning error (inland vs. beachfront)
- Multiple tourism sources (hotel addresses, beach clubs, booking platforms) confirmed correct location
- Research revealed importance of cross-referencing coastal geography for beach breaks
- Alternative names (Playa Waikiki, Galera Beach) required careful location verification
- Sheltered bay location validated through tourism infrastructure and accessibility data
