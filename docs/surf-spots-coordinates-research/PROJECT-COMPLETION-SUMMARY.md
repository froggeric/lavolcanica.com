## MAJOR DISCOVERIES AND CORRECTIONS

### 1. Systematic Coordinate Duplication Database Failure
**Issue:** Multiple spots sharing identical coordinates creating geographic impossibilities

**Examples Discovered:**
- Puerto Lajas & Playa Blanca: Same coordinates, different locations
- Multiple other instances across database

**Impact:** Critical database integrity issue
**Resolution:** Geographic validation and coordinate correction implemented

### 2. Major Coordinate Misplacement Errors
**Largest Error Found:** Punta del Tigre - 76km coordinate deviation
- **Original:** Incorrect location in south-central Fuerteventura
- **Corrected:** Actual southwesternmost point location
- **Validation:** Perfect alignment with professional surf descriptions

**Other Major Errors:** 6+ corrections ranging from 6km to 76km deviations

### 3. Professional Verification Gaps
**Finding:** Many spots lacked professional surf platform documentation
**Causes:** Local names, historical references, expert-only access restrictions
**Resolution:** Geographic logic validation and confidence classification implemented

## VERIFICATION RESULTS SUMMARY

### Overall Success Metrics:
- **Total Spots Researched:** 42/42 (100%)
- **VERIFIED Accuracy:** 26+ spots (62%)
- **Critical Corrections:** 8+ spots (19%)
- **Medium Confidence:** 6 spots (14%)
- **Low Confidence/Manual Review:** 2 spots (5%)

### Accuracy Classification Results:
- **VERIFIED:** Professional source verification with <15m coordinate variation
- **HIGH:** Geographic logic validation with <50m variation
- **MEDIUM:** Single good source or resolvable conflicts
- **LOW:** Limited sources or major conflicts

## DATABASE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

### Pre-Project State:
- Unknown coordinate accuracy
- Systematic duplication errors
- Major misplacement errors
- No verification methodology

### Post-Project State:
