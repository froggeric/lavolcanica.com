# Cruz Roja GPS Coordinates Research

**Research Date:** 2025-11-14
**Spot ID:** cruz-roja
**Primary Name:** Cruz Roja
**Alternative Names:** []

## Current Coordinates in Database
- Latitude: 28.05
- Longitude: -14.3
- Accuracy: unverified

## Research Context
**Geographic Description Analysis:**
- Named after former Red Cross lifeguard house on the beach
- Located at southernmost tip of Fuerteventura
- World-class right-hand point break
- Primary refuge when west coast spots are oversized
- Powerful yet ridable waves that wrap around the island

**Key Geographic Indicators:**
- Southernmost tip location (critical geographic reference)
- Near Morro Jable (nearest town reference)
- Point break formation wrapping around southern tip
- Comparison to Australian Gold Coast point breaks

## Geographic Analysis Based on Context

### Southern Tip Reference Points
Based on southernmost Fuerteventura geography:
- Southern tip coordinates approximately: 28.04° to 28.05° N
- Western side of southern tip: -14.4° to -14.5° W
- Eastern side of southern tip: -14.2° to -14.3° W

### Morro Jable Reference
- Morro Jable town center: approximately 28.05° N, -14.35° W
- Cruz Roja would be south/southwest of Morro Jable
- Consistent with southernmost tip positioning

## Coastal Pattern Analysis

### Southern Fuerteventura Configuration
- Punta de Jandía (southernmost point): ~28.050° N, -14.420° W
- West coast faces Atlantic, more exposed conditions
- East coast more protected, different wave patterns
- Point breaks typically form on headlands/capes

### Cruz Roja Characteristics Analysis
**Point Break Formation Requirements:**
- Requires prominent headland/cap formation
- Wave wrapping around topography
- Consistent swell exposure
- Southern tip location fits perfectly

## Database Coordinate Evaluation
**Current Coordinates:** 28.05, -14.3
- **Latitude:** 28.05° N - Consistent with southern tip latitude
- **Longitude:** -14.3° W - Places on southeastern side, not consistent with western point break description

**Geographic Conflict:**
- Point breaks requiring "wrapping around island" typically occur on western headlands
- Current coordinates place spot on southeastern side
- May need western positioning for proper wave dynamics

## Professional Surf Knowledge Application

### Fuerteventura South Pattern Recognition
From similar south coast spots researched:
- El Pozo (lighthouse area): around 28.05°, -14.3°
- Esquinzo areas: around 28.07° to 28.67°, -14.00° to -14.30°
- Cofete area: around 28.74°, -13.93° (west coast)

### Regional Surf Logic
- **West Coast Point Breaks:** Require western exposure for "wrapping" dynamics
- **Eastern Side:** Typically beach breaks, not point formations
- **Southern Tip:** Complex geography with multiple potential break locations

## Source Credibility Assessment
**Limitations:**
- Unable to access external surf databases
- Limited to geographic pattern analysis
- Professional surf platform verification unavailable

**Available Analysis:**
- Geographic logic based on coastal morphology
- Reference point correlation with nearby spots
- Wave physics requirements for point breaks

## Confidence Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Geographic pattern analysis suggests current coordinates may need western positioning, but lack of external source verification requires manual confirmation.

**Key Issues:**
- Point break description conflicts with eastern side positioning
- Southern tip location confirmed by latitude
- Longitude may need adjustment for western exposure

## Recommended Actions
**MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED**
- Verify if Cruz Roja is on western or eastern side of southern tip
- Confirm point break orientation (right-hand wave direction)
- Cross-reference with local surf guides/maritime charts
- Validate Red Cross lifeguard house historical location

## Research Limitations
This analysis was conducted without access to:
- Professional surf platform databases (Surfline, MagicSeaweed)
- Local surf school documentation
- Spanish maritime/geographic data
- German tourism surf resources
- Satellite imagery validation

## Geographic Recommendation
Based on available geographic analysis:
- **Latitude:** 28.05° N appears correct for southern tip
- **Longitude:** May need adjustment to western side (-14.4° to -14.5° W) for proper point break formation
