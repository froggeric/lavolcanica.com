- Puerto de la Cruz proximity (0.6km)

## CRITICAL COORDINATE ERROR IDENTIFIED

### Geographic Plausibility Analysis
**Current Coordinates:** 28.6742° N, -14.0076° W

**Major Geographic Problems:**
1. **Latitude:** 28.6742° N places location in NORTH Fuerteventura
2. **Longitude:** -14.0076° W places location inland/away from coast
3. **Distance Error:** Approximately 65km north of expected Jandía Natural Park location
4. **Area Conflict:** Described as "South" area but coordinates place in North
5. **Park Location Error:** Coordinates not within Jandía Natural Park boundaries

### Identical Error Pattern to Esquinzo
**Systematic Coordinate Duplication:**
- **La Turbia:** 28.6742° N, -14.0076° W
- **Esquinzo:** 28.6742° N, -14.0076° W (identical coordinates)
- **Pattern:** Systematic placeholder coordinate usage
- **Error Magnitude:** Both spots ~65km north of actual locations

**Jandía Natural Park Geographic Reality:**
- **Actual Location:** Southern tip of Fuerteventura
- **Latitude Range:** ~28.0° to 28.2° N
- **Longitude Range:** ~-14.2° to -14.5° W
- **Current Coordinates:** Place spot in completely wrong region

## Geographic Logic Analysis

### Jandía Natural Park Requirements
**Correct Location Characteristics:**
- Must be within Jandía Natural Park boundaries
- Should be in southern Fuerteventura (South area)
- Should be coastal (beach break)
- Should be near Cofete area (west coast)
- Should be remote and wild (park characteristics)

### Current Coordinates Geographic Reality
**28.6742° N, -14.0076° W Location Analysis:**
- **Region:** North-central Fuerteventura
- **Terrain:** Inland area, not coastal
- **Park Status:** Not within Jandía Natural Park
- **Accessibility:** Not remote (near developed areas)
- **Description Mismatch:** Complete contradiction with wild, remote beach description

## Comparative Analysis with Correct Locations

### Expected Jandía Natural Park Location
**Based on Geographic Logic:**
- **Latitude:** ~28.05° to 28.15° N (southern tip)
- **Longitude:** ~-14.3° to -14.5° W (west coast side)
- **Proximity to Cofete:** Within few kilometers
- **Coastal Positioning:** Must be on coastline
- **Park Boundaries:** Within protected natural area

### Reference Point Analysis
**Cofete Relationship:**
- **Cofete Coordinates:** 28.7415° N, -13.9353° W
- **La Turbia Description:** Near Cofete, in same natural park
- **Expected Location:** West coast of southern peninsula
- **Current Error:** North of Cofete, not in same geographic area

## Systematic Coordinate Error Pattern

### Previous Batch Error Discoveries
**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Las Playas Muelle:** 54km northward error (previous batch)
- **Esquinzo:** 70km northward error (this batch)
- **La Turbia:** 65km northward error (this batch)
- **Systematic Issue:** Placeholder coordinate duplication problem

**Placeholder Coordinate Evidence:**
- Multiple spots with identical coordinates (28.6742, -14.0076)
- Northward placement bias in errors
- Inland positioning for coastal spots
- Consistent pattern across multiple research batches

## Correction Requirements

### Immediate Geographic Correction
**Required Changes:**
- **Latitude:** Change from 28.6742° N to ~28.05° N (southward move)
- **Longitude:** Change from -14.0076° W to ~-14.4° W (westward coastal move)
- **Distance Correction:** ~65km southwest relocation
- **Park Placement:** Within Jandía Natural Park boundaries

### Geographic Logic Correction
**Proper Location Characteristics:**
- **South Area:** Correct classification
- **Jandía Natural Park:** Within protected boundaries
- **Coastal Positioning:** On west coast for dramatic cliffs
- **Remote Access:** Consistent with wild, undeveloped description
- **Cofete Proximity:** Near known reference point

## Confidence Assessment
**LOW** - Current coordinates have major geographic errors requiring immediate correction

**Critical Issues:**
1. **65km geographic error** (north instead of south)
2. **Park boundary violation** (not in Jandía Natural Park)
3. **Inland positioning** for coastal beach description
4. **Area classification conflict** (South area, North coordinates)
5. **Placeholder coordinate duplication** (identical to Esquinzo error)

## Suggested Correction
**Approximate Correct Coordinates:** 28.05° to 28.10° N, -14.35° to -14.45° W

**Correction Logic:**
- **Latitude:** ~28.07° N (southern Jandía peninsula)
- **Longitude:** ~-14.40° W (west coast within natural park)
- **Cofete Relationship:** Within 5-10km of Cofete beach
- **Park Boundaries:** Within Jandía Natural Park
- **Coastal Position:** On dramatic west coast cliffs

## Recommended Actions
**IMMEDIATE COORDINATE CORRECTION REQUIRED**
- Update coordinates to place within Jandía Natural Park
- Move location to southern Fuerteventura west coast
- Resolve coordinate duplication with Esquinzo
- Verify with external sources when available
- Update accuracy status after correction

## Geographic Error Alert
**CRITICAL ERROR DISCOVERED:** 65km coordinate error placing spot outside of Jandía Natural Park and in wrong region entirely. Part of systematic placeholder coordinate duplication pattern affecting multiple spots.
