### Sources Found

#### Tier 3 Sources (Local Tourism/Surf Schools)
1. **Freshsurf** - Detailed spot description
   - URL: https://www.freshsurf.de/en/spotfinder/
   - Details: "La Concava. Shallow left and right reefbreek on the inside of Mejiones. Also called 'Lazy's': you hardly have to paddle to get barreled!"
   - Reliability: HIGH - Local surf school with expert knowledge

#### Limited Source Analysis
**Critical Issue:** Very limited source material found for La Concava
- Only 1 direct source discovered despite extensive multi-language searching
- No GPS coordinates found in any accessible source
- Spot appears to be a lesser-known or localized break

## Geographic Validation

### Current Coordinate Analysis
- **Current Coordinates:** 28.7415, -13.9353
- **Issue:** These coordinates are identical to multiple other North Shore spots (Majanicho area)
- **Problem:** Likely represents general area rather than specific break location

### Location Description from Sources
- **Position:** "on the inside of Mejillones bay"
- **Alternative Name:** "Lazy's" (suggesting easy paddle/minimum effort)
- **Characteristics:** "Shallow left and right reef break"
- **Special Feature:** "you hardly have to paddle to get barreled"

### Mejillones Bay Context
- La Concava is positioned inside Mejillones bay
- This is a specific geographic area on the North Shore
- The bay contains multiple reef breaks
- "Inside" positioning suggests protected bay location

### Relative Positioning Challenges
- **Current Coordinates:** Place spot in general Majanicho area
- **Actual Location:** Should be inside Mejillones bay proper
- **Geographic Mismatch:** Current coordinates may not reflect precise bay location

## Confidence Assessment

### Source Reliability Score
- **Tier 2 Sources:** 0 (no professional surf platform sources found)
- **Tier 3 Sources:** 1 (Freshsurf local surf school)
- **Geographic Validation:** Limited - single description source
- **Coordinate Sources:** 0 (no GPS coordinates found)

### Research Challenges
1. **Limited Source Availability:** Only 1 source found despite extensive searching
2. **No GPS Data:** No sources provide exact coordinates
3. **Name Variations:** Multiple alternative names may complicate searches
4. **Geographic Specificity:** "Inside Mejillones bay" requires precise local knowledge
5. **Spot Obscurity:** May be a localized or lesser-known break

### Verification Status
**CONFIDENCE LEVEL: LOW**

**Rationale for LOW Confidence:**
1. **Insufficient Sources:** Only 1 source found (below minimum 3-source requirement)
2. **No GPS Data:** No coordinates found in any source
3. **Geographic Uncertainty:** Current coordinates may not reflect actual location
4. **Limited Documentation:** Spot appears poorly documented in mainstream surf platforms
5. **Localization Issue:** May be known primarily to local surfers only

## Recommendation

**FLAG FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION**

### Issues Requiring Manual Review:
1. **Insufficient Source Data:** Only 1 source found (need minimum 3 for verification)
2. **No GPS Coordinates:** No coordinate data available from any source
3. **Geographic Uncertainty:** Current coordinates likely inaccurate
4. **Spot Identification:** May need local knowledge to precisely locate
5. **Name Confirmation:** Verify if "La Concava" and "Lazy's" refer to same break

### Suggested Verification Methods:
1. **Local Knowledge:** Contact Fuerteventura local surf schools for precise location
2. **Satellite Imagery:** Analyze Mejillones bay for reef break formations
3. **Field Verification:** On-site GPS coordinate collection
4. **Community Sources:** Check local surfer forums and community knowledge
5. **Spanish Language Sources:** Search Spanish local surf forums and databases

### Estimated Coordinate Range (Based on Description)
- **Area:** Inside Mejillones bay
- **Likely Position:** ~28.73-28.74 latitude, -13.93 to -13.95 longitude
- **Note:** This is an estimate based on bay geography, not verified coordinates

## Research Notes

- Spot appears to be a lesser-known or localized break inside Mejillones bay
- Alternative name "Lazy's" suggests easy access or minimal paddling required
- Description indicates it's a shallow reef break with barrel potential
- Current coordinates appear to be generic North Shore coordinates
- May be known primarily to local surfers rather than documented in mainstream platforms
- Geographic specificity of "inside Mejillones bay" provides some location guidance
